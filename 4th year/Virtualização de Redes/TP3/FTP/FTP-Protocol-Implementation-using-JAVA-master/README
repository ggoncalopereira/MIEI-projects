*** Welcome to the Floodlight v1.0 VM! ***

This Ubuntu 14.04 VM includes:
1) Floodlight v1.0
2) Eclipse (w/Floodlight imported)
2) Mininet v2.2.0
3) Open vSwitch v2.3.1
4) Wireshark w/OpenFlow dissector


*** The following is useful information to get started ***
1) VM Credentials
--username:
  floodlight
--password:
  floodlight

2) Useful Paths
--Floodlight is installed at:
  /home/floodlight/floodlight
--The Terminal can be found at:
  Applications->Accessories->Terminal
--Eclipse can be found at:
  Applications->Programming->Eclipse
--Firefox can be found at:
  Applications->Internet->Firefox Web Browser

3) Documentation
--Firefox's home page defaults to the Floodlight Documentation wiki.
--The Floodlight developer's group is always available to assist with any questions you may have:
  floodlight-dev@openflowhub.org

4) Examples
--Example command to use Mininet, OVS, and Floodlight with OpenFlow 1.3:
  sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=127.0.0.1,port=6653 --switch ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13

--Example command to view flow table contents (outside of mininet):
  sudo ovs-ofctl dump-flows s1 table=0 -O OpenFlow13

5) Notes
--By default, Floodlight inserts zero-priority flows in all OpenFlow 1.3+ switch flow tables to forward table-misses to the controller. When dumping flows, filter by table (as shown above) to limit the output to the scope applicable to your application. Omitting the "table=XXX" parameter will default to show all tables (which produces a lot of output due to the many table-miss flows). In OpenFlow 1.0, the table-miss behavior is "embedded" within the table, so the table-miss flows will not be present in OpenFlow 1.0 switches.

--Other "Floodlight" desktop backgrounds are available in /home/floodlight/Pictures if you would prefer another. I apologize in advance for my amateur Photoshop skills =)
